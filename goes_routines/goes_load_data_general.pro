;See the XRS Readme for more information on the GOES XRS instrument.
;To load and plot the 1-min averaged X-ray flux as measured by the XRS instrument onboard GOES-10 on March, 22, 2008:

;Fluxgate Magnetometer (FGM)
;Load and plot 1-min averaged data for both FGM sensors on GOES-15 for the day of March 17, 2013:

;Magnetospheric Electron Detector (MAGED)

;To calculate the pitch angles corresponding to each MAGED telescope head (FGM data must be loaded):
goes_lib ; compile the GOES library routines

;Electron, Proton, Alpha Detector (EPEAD)
;Warning about "east" and "west" look directions
;The GOES 13-15 satellites are capable of undergoing a yaw flip, resulting in the EPEAD pointing directions labeled as 'east' and 'west' being switched. Care must be taken to ensure 'east' and 'west' refer to the same directions when comparing EPEAD data from one time interval to another.
;To read more on this issue, see the note at NGDC: Note on GOES 13‚Äê15 Solar Protons and Yaw Flips



;Load and plot the 2.5MeV, uncorrected proton flux as observed by the GOES-15 EPEAD instrument for the day of March 17, 2013:
goes_load_data, trange=['2013-03-17', '2013-03-18'], datatype='epead', probes='15', /avg_1m
tplot, 'g15_prot_2.5MeV_uncor_flux'

;To calculate and plot the center pitch angles for the east and west heads of the EPEAD instrument, first load the FGM data:
goes_load_data, trange=['2013-03-17', '2013-03-18'], datatype='fgm', probes='15', /avg_1m

;then compile the GOES library file, goes_lib:
goes_lib ; compile GOES support routines
;and finally use goes_epead_center_pitch_angles to calculate the pitch angles from the magnetic field in spacecraft coordinates:
goes_epead_center_pitch_angles, 'g15_Bsc_1', 'g15_BTSC_1'
tplot, 'goes_epead_center_pitch_angles'



;High Energy Proton and Alpha Detector (HEPAD)
